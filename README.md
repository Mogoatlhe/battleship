# Battleship

## Purpose

Implementing the Battleship [game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>) in JavaScript following TDD principles using the Jest testing framework.

## Requirements

- [ ] Make the computer capable of making random plays
  - it should not make the same move twice

- [ ] End the game once one player's ships have all been sunk
- OPTIONAL:
  - [ ] Create a two player option that lets users take turns by passing the device back and forth
    - [ ] make sure the game is playable on a mobile device
    - [ ] implement a "pass device" feature
